      <h1>Account Hub Shop Redesign: Leading Through Crisis</h1>

      <p>One week before engineering handoff, the lead designer left the project. I was the only designer with cross-domain visibility across Hub, prior e-commerce experience, and established executive trust. I stepped in — and what followed wasn't a one-week sprint. It was four weeks of unglamorous audit work and proactive definition that made execution possible when Shop suddenly became the company's top priority.</p>

      <h2>The Situation</h2>

      <p>T-Mobile for Business needed a redesigned Shop experience inside Account Hub — the primary platform for enterprise customers to manage devices, lines, and accounts. The project had been in motion, but the work was unstable: exploratory scope had accumulated, requirements were unresolved, and the lead designer left the week before engineering handoff.</p>

      <p>I was leading Account Hub under a Principal Designer, overseeing scope and strategy across multiple teams. When Shop destabilized, I stepped in. Ramping someone new would have introduced risk we couldn't absorb. I had the context, the relationships, and the cross-domain visibility to move quickly.</p>

      <div class="case-pull-quote">
        <p>The project didn't need a hero. It needed someone willing to do slow, unglamorous diagnostic work without an audience — and then be ready when the moment came.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-divider"></div>

      <h2>The Work Nobody Saw</h2>

      <p>IT quickly realized the original timeline was unrealistic. Shop was deprioritized to #3 while engineering redirected elsewhere. We gained time — but lost active support. I used that window deliberately.</p>

      <h2>When Priorities Shifted</h2>

      <p>Two weeks in, Shop jumped from #3 to #1. The preparation work became the foundation the team needed to execute quickly. With alignment in place, I proposed reducing 8 flows to 3 foundational ones — creating a complete purchase journey and a scalable architecture future flows could plug into.</p>

        <div class="case-flow-card">

          <h3 class="case-flow-title">Lower Funnel (Checkout)</h3>
          <div class="case-flow-line" aria-hidden="true"></div>
          <p class="case-flow-desc">Shared completion layer across all flows.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Deprioritizing 5 flows — including Saved Orders, a committed Q1 feature — required careful framing. I didn't present these as cuts. I framed them as protection: protecting architectural integrity, protecting launch confidence, protecting the ability to deliver deferred features well. I advocated for a fast-follow release on Saved Orders (4–6 weeks post-launch) rather than risk a compromised launch. Stakeholders aligned.</p>

      <div class="case-divider"></div>

      <h2>The Pivot</h2>

      <p>Days before the VP review, the design direction shifted while I was briefly out. The revised concept prioritized long-term scalability but diverged from established commerce patterns — unfamiliar interaction models in a high-stakes checkout flow.</p>

      <p>The VP's feedback was direct: <em>"Don't reinvent the wheel."</em></p>

      <p>In critical workflows like checkout, users don't want novelty. They want clarity and predictability. I pivoted to conventional interaction patterns — not as a creative compromise, but as a strategic choice grounded in what enterprise users actually need when completing a purchase for dozens of devices. Working with the team, I delivered the revised designs on time.</p>

      <div class="case-divider"></div>

      <h2>Systemic Impact</h2>

      <p>While executing, I collaborated with our Design Systems lead to build reusable components adopted by other vertical leads across the platform. The operating framework and component patterns reduced duplication, improved consistency, and accelerated subsequent vertical work. We weren't just solving for Shop — we were building infrastructure for the broader Hub redesign.</p>

      <h2>Moving Forward</h2>

      <p>With the foundation stabilized, we shifted from crisis management to proactive iteration. I'm working with research partners to identify high-impact opportunities grounded in usage data and customer behavior, and facilitating cross-functional prioritization to sequence iterative improvements alongside 2026 roadmap initiatives. The shift is intentional: from reactive scope management to evidence-based platform evolution.</p>

            <h3>Clarity is the most valuable artifact in chaos</h3>

          </div>
        </div>

      </div>

      <p>This project also surfaced a structural gap worth naming: design was brought in at the end of an IT-driven process, limiting our ability to influence technical decisions that directly affected the experience. Going forward, I'm advocating for earlier design involvement in infrastructure planning — not to own the roadmap, but to ensure experience implications are considered before constraints are locked.</p>
