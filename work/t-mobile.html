          <p>One week before engineering handoff, the lead designer left the project. I was leading Account Hub under a Principal Designer, overseeing scope and strategy across multiple teams. When Shop destabilized, I stepped in. I was the only designer with cross-domain visibility across Hub, prior e-commerce experience, and established executive trust — ramping someone new would have introduced risk we couldn’t absorb.</p>
        <p>What followed wasn't a one-week sprint. It was four weeks of diagnosis, unglamorous audit work, and proactive definition — most of it done without full team support — that made execution possible when Shop suddenly became the company's top priority with a week to deliver.</p>

        <div class="case-prose case-prose-wide reveal-ready reveal-stagger-2">
          <p>Very quickly, IT realized the original timeline was unrealistic. Shop was deprioritized to #3 while engineering redirected to other initiatives. We gained time — but lost active support.</p>
          <p>I audited all 8 flows, mapping dependencies and completion states. I met directly with cross-functional partners to surface real requirements — separating what was essential from what had accumulated through scope creep. I audited the live experience to identify structural gaps, friction points, and enterprise edge cases the previous designs hadn't accounted for. I removed exploratory features that didn't serve the foundational experience and made targeted UI and flow changes grounded in what the current experience actually needed.</p>
          <p>This was slow, unglamorous work done largely without support. But it produced something essential: clarity about what Shop actually needed to be — and prevented exploratory ambiguity from reaching development when Shop reactivated.</p>
          <p>To structure decision-making going forward, I created an experience review document — inspired by Amazon's review process — that gave the team a shared operating system for saying no. It captured stakeholder mapping, scope boundaries, requirements provenance, escalation paths, and aligned decisions. When new requests surfaced, we asked: does this serve the defined success criteria? When scope pressure returned, we referenced documented alignment instead of relitigating. The framework became a reusable template across Hub initiatives and is still used today.</p>

        <div class="case-prose case-prose-wide reveal-ready reveal-stagger-2">
        <p>Two weeks in, Shop jumped from #3 to #1. The preparation work I'd done in the quiet period was now the foundation the team needed to execute quickly.</p>
        <p>With alignment in place, I proposed scoping to 3 foundational flows:</p>
        <div class="case-flows-container">
          <div class="case-flow-card reveal-ready reveal-stagger-1">

            <div class="case-flow-line" aria-hidden="true"></div>

            <p class="case-flow-desc">Shared completion layer across all flows.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Together, these created a complete purchase journey and a scalable architecture future flows could plug into.</p>
        <p>I deprioritized 5 flows — including Saved Orders, a committed Q1 feature. Rather than framing these as cuts, I reframed around protection: to protect architectural integrity, to protect launch confidence, to protect the ability to deliver deferred features well.I advocated for a fast-follow release on Saved Orders (4–6 weeks) rather than risk a compromised launch. Stakeholders aligned.</p>

          <blockquote class="case-pullquote">In critical workflows like checkout, users don't want novelty. They want clarity and predictability.</blockquote>
          <p>I pivoted to conventional interaction patterns — not as a creative compromise, but as a strategic choice. Working with the team, I delivered the revised designs on time.</p>
